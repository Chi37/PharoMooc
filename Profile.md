# Profiles
We propose some profiles to help you navigating in the topics and selecting what you want to learn.
We tagged some lectures with the profiles and mentioned also the lectures that you may want to skip
in a first place because they are on specific topics such as files, exceptions or other topics that you may not need right at the beginning.


We propose five profiles to following this mooc. 

### Total newbies [newbies]
Focus on the beginning of the lectures, you can skip the Seaside/Mongo and tinyBlog exercises. 
Follow the end of the Mooc but without trying to understand everything. Take it easy and spend time understanding that the system is written in itself. Focus on the navigation tools (senders and implementors).


###Looking for Web [web]
For those that focus on the web, we suggest to get started with the syntax (since we really love this lecture you should really watch the not implementation and sequels), then look at Tea pot and Seaside/Mongo combo.
From the exercise stand point, focus on tinychat and tinyblog.

###Refresh your OO perspective [oo]
If you want to rethink your OO perspective, pay attention that even Pharo simple libraries such as collections are immersive. Yes you send a message to a collection to perform a loop. Yes you send a message to a Boolean to perform a conditional


###Looking for Black Magic [magic]
If you are interesting in black magic it probably means that you get fast in learning a new language or that you already some Pharo. Still do not miss the OO perspective. 

### Wanna be a Pharo expert [Xpert]
Well it means that you should have a look at everything and that you may drop the web part if you are in a hurry.
