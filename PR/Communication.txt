Thank you very much to Damien, Stephane, and Luc for their work on the material! I enjoyed it very much- Hey, I've just finished the Mooc. It's awesome.

Additionally, there must be a bug in the scoring algorithm, since I got >100% even though I failed some quizs.- Hey all - I've just finished the Mooc - thanks for an excellent course and a thouroughly interesting look at a new way to program :smile: Looking forward to starting to play with Pharo on some upcoming ideas I've had👌3- I already had previous Smalltalk experience, but yes, I'm extremely happy Chapter 7 has been extremely fulfilling- A general comment I wanted to make is that the MOOC so far has been great. Impressed with the quality and content, and grateful that it is available and free. Many thanks! Aryeh- Merci beaucoup! 👍1 🇫🇷1- IMHO the videos were very well done.
